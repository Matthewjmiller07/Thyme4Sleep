        \textit{\footnotesize ``You helped me get my life back and I couldn't recommend her enough! My baby still wasn't sleeping through the night at 5 months. With your guidance and support we finally managed to get her through the night within a week of sleep training her. You were so easy to work with, really listened to our concerns and created a sleep training plan perfectly tailored to our baby who had been struggling with reflux. It was a pleasure working with you!''} \\[0.05cm] % Reduced space

Even though my baby was a month premature with your guidance he starting sleeping through at 12 weeks. Her support, clear and precise guidance and no judgment advice helped me and my baby sleep though and have the best start to our life together.''} \\[0.05cm] % Reduced space
