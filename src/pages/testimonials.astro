With your guidance and support we finally managed to get her through the night within a week of sleep training her. You were so easy to work with, really listened to our concerns and created a sleep training plan perfectly tailored to our baby who had been struggling with reflux. It was a pleasure working with you!',

Even though my baby was a month premature with your guidance he starting sleeping through at 12 weeks. Her support, clear and precise guidance and no judgment advice helped me and my baby sleep though and have the best start to our life together.',

  content: `Georgia was honestly amazing. She took so much time to really listen and explain things and gave us practical advice. She was patient and always there when we had questions. Knowing she has kids meant she has real experience not just theories. Everything she suggested felt doable, and most importantly, it worked. She also helped us when we traveled from London to New York as we adjusted to the time zone. We're so grateful for her support and wouldn't hesitate to recommend her to anyone.`,
